<flash usage>
* store bitmaps in unused parts of other bitmaps (walls, status pane) or blank them out (like "Victory" in status pane)

<handling>
* automatically place monsters in level during startup

<performance>
* store all visible walls/items in a small array (5x3 bytes) before rendering a frame
