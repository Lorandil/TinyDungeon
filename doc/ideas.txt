Ideas for improvements

* display damage dealt/received on screen
  - perhaps comic like with spikes (*POW*)
  - monster inflicted damage right near the players HP
  - player inflicted damage central on the dungeon screen
  - mask required (bitmap is 24x24 -> 144 bytes required )
  - font is 7x3, 30 bytes required (probably 40 bytes to simplify adressing)

Done

+ scale hit points by 2 (again)
+ add version info to panel
