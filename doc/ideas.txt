Ideas for improvements

* double bars "riddle" is too hard/frustrating and lacks logic, perhaps add a third switch for amusement
* dynamic lighting effect not hardcoded, but using a table with 2 mask bytes per distance (8 bytes in total)
  - would enable dynamic light range for torch or lamp
* fix lighting anomaly for front wall in distance 1 (shouldn't be dithered)
* display damage dealt/received on screen
  - perhaps comic like with spikes (*POW*)
  - monster inflicted damage right near the players HP
  - player inflicted damage central on the dungeon screen
  - mask required (bitmap is 24x24 -> 144 bytes required )
  - font is 7x3, 30 bytes required (probably 40 bytes to simplify adressing)
* on game start
  - fade in (by using the lighting)
* on player death
  - fade to black (by using the lighting)

Done
+ scale hit points by 2 (again)
+ add version info to panel (to the graphics of course
