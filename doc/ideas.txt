Ideas for improvements

* double bars "riddle" is too hard/frustrating and lacks logic, perhaps add a third switch for amusement instead
* fix lighting anomaly for front wall in distance 1 (shouldn't be dithered)
* dynamic lighting range for torch or lamp? breathing view distance?
* use and improve dynamic lighting for objects (use offset of -2 for more clarity?)
* display damage dealt/received on screen
  - perhaps comic like with spikes (*POW*)
  - monster inflicted damage right near the players HP
  - player inflicted damage central on the dungeon screen
  - mask required (bitmap is 24x24 -> 144 bytes required )
  - font is 7x3, 30 bytes required (probably 40 bytes to simplify adressing)

Done
+ scale hit points by 2 (again)
+ add version info to panel (to the graphics of course
+ dynamic lighting effect not hardcoded, but using a table with 2 mask bytes per distance (8 bytes in total + 8 bytes for fading in and out)
  + on game start fade in
  + on player death fade to black
