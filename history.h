#ifdef _HISTORY_

History and open points list of TinyDungeon

already achieved:
* make walls solid
* copy level from flash to RAM
* store level dimensions in level structure,
  thus enabling arbitrary level sizes
  add information about stairs up and down to the level structure, too
* mirror walls between odd and even cells
* added skeleton and beholder bitmap
* very plain draw function (buggy!) for non-wall-objects
* use solid bit
* add scaling


next steps:
* extend object drawing to full field of view
* add floor graphics
* add compass
* add stairs up/down
* add monster(s)
* add treasure

* ...
* have fun!
