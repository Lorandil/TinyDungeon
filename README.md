# TinyDungeon
 Just a simple DungeonMaster "clone". let's see how far we can get!

# The Idea
I always liked games like The Bard's Tale or DungeonMaster in the 80's and early 90's.
When I discovered Daniel C's TinyJoypad project I was stunned by all the cool retro like
games Daniel had created. 

I started to play with the code of Tiny invaders and decided to try to make it even a little more fun (check the result here: https://github.com/Lorandil/Tiny-invaders-v4.2).
When I had finished most of my ideas on that project, I thought of a game project of my own.
Why not something like a 3D dungeon crawler on a TinyJoypad?
